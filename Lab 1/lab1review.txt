Summary:

- The summary has poor quality. 37% of what you wrote comes exactly from the
  article, and that is not good. You can see your report on iLearn/Turnitin.


\LaTeX:

- Good usage of tables and items. Good job!

- When using tables, try to keep the \hline inline with the \\ to save row
  space.

- You should only use \begin{center} for text you want centered. The entire
  document was centerd. That is wrong. You should remove all these tags unless
  you want to center a specific part of your document.

- When writing \LaTeX, try to keep every line of text within 80 characters or
  100 at the most, then continue in a new line, \LaTeX will continue if you
  break lines.
