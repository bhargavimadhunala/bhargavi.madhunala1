Correctness:

- The program produces incorrect output. The program produces this:
$ java Driver < testcase.txt
your key is:5468617473206D79204B756E67204675

- The program produces output in the incorrect format.

 
Style:

- Both files have major style problems. You are not following the style
  guidelines.

- Incorrect indentation in both the driver and aescipher files. Please use a
  two-space indentation.

- Poor block comments

- Both files are missing the header. Remember: Each file must have a block
  comment at the top which gives the name of the file, the student's name, the
  assignment, the date, the version, and a comment about what is contained in
  the file. For example:
/**
 * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
 * author: student name
 * course: CMPT 220
 * assignment: project 1
 * due date: August 30, 2003
 * version: 1.3
 * 
 * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
 * type.
 */

- Both files have incorrect method header formatting. Each function must have a
  comment block before it, which gives the function name, describes each
  parameter and the return value (if any), and explains the purpose of the
  function. Refer to the parameters by name, not by type. Here is an example:
/**
 * factorial
 *
 * This function computes the factorial of the given input. The factorial is
 * defined as factorial(n) = n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   n: the number on which to compute the factorial
 * 
 * Return value: the factorial of n, or 1 if n <= 0.
 */
public static int factorial(int n) {
  if (n <= 0) {
    return 1;
  }
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}


Efficiency and Other Comments:

- It seems like you are doing completely different from what you were
  instructed to do. Please follow the handout.

- The driver.java file is incorrecly named as: Driver.java

- The aescipher.java file is incorrectly named as: AES.java
